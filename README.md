Calculus-captive
================
Calculus-captive is an Android application that teaches university-level calculus through a text-based adventure game. The game contains two modes: story mode and practice mode. In story mode, the user plays a character who has awoken in a strange, dark room with no recollection of who they are. The player must correctly answer multiple-choice calculus questions to navigate through the story.  The profile section shows the player's progress in the game. In practice mode, the user can choose a particular calculus topic to focus on, such as derivatives or integrals. 

The game is currently available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.sfu.group04termproject).
